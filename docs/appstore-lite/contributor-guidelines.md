# Community Blueprint Contributor Guidelines

Last updated: 2026-02-07

## Scope

These guidelines apply to blueprints published through `Community Blueprints` in SMT.

## Submission Checklist

1. Include clear `title`, `summary`, `category`, and meaningful tags.
2. Provide a non-empty `promptPack.seedPrompt` that can regenerate the blueprint intent.
3. Ensure the package validates in-app (manifest + system payload checks).
4. Confirm the system contains:
   - goals
   - yearly initiatives
   - work packages
   - capacity configuration
5. Avoid secrets and private data (API keys, tokens, personal email lists, confidential customer names).
6. Use “inspired-by” wording for well-known products; avoid impersonation or trademark misuse.

## Trust Labels

1. `Verified`: Curated and quality-checked by maintainers.
2. `Community`: User-submitted and validated for schema compliance.
3. `Experimental`: Early concept blueprints that are structurally valid but not deeply curated.

## Publishing Terms

1. By publishing, you assert you have rights to share the content.
2. Published blueprints may be remixed by other users.
3. Do not upload unlawful, harassing, or sensitive personal content.
4. Maintainers may remove or relabel entries that violate policy.

## Quality Recommendations

1. Keep initiative-to-goal links complete.
2. Keep work package links and dependencies coherent.
3. Keep dates in a rolling 3-year window.
4. Add at least one practical learning outcome for educational reuse.
