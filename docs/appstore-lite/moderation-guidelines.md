# Community Blueprint Moderation Guidelines

Last updated: 2026-02-07

## Moderation Goals

1. Keep the catalog safe and educational.
2. Preserve trust labels as reliable quality signals.
3. Remove sensitive or policy-violating content quickly.

## Review Criteria

1. Policy safety:
   - no secrets/tokens
   - no personal sensitive data
   - no abusive or unlawful content
2. Data quality:
   - installs successfully in SMT
   - includes prompt pack and learning outcomes
   - has non-empty goals, initiatives, and work packages
3. Naming quality:
   - prefer “inspired-by” descriptions
   - avoid direct impersonation of trademarks/brands

## Label Policy

1. `Experimental`:
   - valid package, limited quality review
2. `Community`:
   - valid package, basic content review complete
3. `Verified`:
   - complete quality rubric pass, smoke install tested

## Escalation

1. Remove content immediately for clear policy violations.
2. Downgrade trust label if quality degrades.
3. Track repeat offenders and block new submissions if required.
