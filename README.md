## 1. Purpose

This tool provides a unified platform to:

* **Model Software Architecture:** Define systems, services, APIs, and their dependencies.
* **Map Organizational Structure:** Link teams to services, assign engineers (including AI Software Engineers), and represent management hierarchies.
* **Visualize Relationships:** Understand how services connect, how teams are structured, and how they relate to the software they own.
* **Plan Capacity & Resources:** Configure detailed capacity constraints (leave, overheads, team activities, etc.) and AI productivity gains to understand true team availability (Net Project SDE Years).
* **Manage Roadmaps & Backlogs:** Define, prioritize, and manage initiatives from backlog through to completion, focusing on strategic alignment and product management needs.
* **Execute Yearly Planning:** Commit initiatives to a yearly plan, assign detailed engineering estimates, and track against calculated team capacities.
* **Gain Strategic Insights:** Use the dashboard to visualize investment allocation, track strategic trends over time, and monitor progress towards business goals.
* **Forecast Team Growth:** Model SDE hiring, ramp-up, and attrition, factoring in detailed capacity constraints to predict resource availability.

The ultimate goal is to enable better-informed decision-making for software delivery, resource allocation, and strategic planning.

## 2. Getting Started

Upon launching the application, you'll see the main menu on the top bar:

### Loading a Saved System

* Click **"Load System"**.
* A dialog will appear listing all previously saved systems.
* Click the "Load" button next to the system you wish to work with.
* The application comes with pre-configured sample systems (`StreamView` and `ConnectPro`) to help you explore its features.

### Creating a New System

* Click **"New System"**.
* You will be taken to the "Edit System" page with a new, default system structure.
* Fill in the "System Name" and "System Description".
* Proceed to define your services, teams, managers, and other relevant data.
* Remember to click **"Save All Changes"** at the bottom of the edit page.

### Deleting a System

* Click **"Delete System"** from the home page menu.
* A dialog will list saved systems. Click "Delete" next to the desired system.
* A confirmation prompt will appear before permanent deletion.

### Resetting to Defaults

* Click **"Reset Defaults"**.
* **Caution:** This action will erase ALL currently saved systems and restore the initial sample systems (`StreamView`, `ConnectPro`). This cannot be undone.
* A confirmation prompt will appear before deletion.

## 3. Core Concepts & Data Model

Understanding these core entities is key to using the tool effectively. Most entities include an extensible `attributes: {}` object for future flexibility.

### System

* The highest-level entity, representing a collection of related software services (e.g., a product or platform).
* Attributes: `systemName`, `systemDescription`, and an extensible `attributes` object.

### Services & APIs

* **Services:** Logical components within a system providing specific business functionalities.
    * Attributes: `serviceName`, `serviceDescription`, `owningTeamId`, an array of `apis`, `serviceDependencies` (other services it relies on), `platformDependencies`, and an extensible `attributes` object.
* **APIs:** Public interfaces exposed by a service.
    * Attributes: `apiName`, `apiDescription`, `dependentApis` (other APIs it calls), and an extensible `attributes` object.

### Teams (2-Pizza Teams)

* Agile software development teams responsible for building and maintaining services.
* Attributes: `teamId` (unique), `teamName` (official name), `teamIdentity` (codename/nickname), `teamDescription`, `sdmId`, `pmtId`, `fundedHeadcount`.
* `engineers`: An array of engineer names (strings) who are primary members of this team. These names link to entries in the global `allKnownEngineers` list.
* `awayTeamMembers`: An array of objects, where each object represents a borrowed engineer and includes `{ name, level, sourceTeam, attributes }`.
* `teamCapacityAdjustments`: A detailed object for configuring team-specific capacity modifiers (see [Capacity Configuration](#capacity-configuration)).
* Extensible `attributes` object.

### Engineers (`allKnownEngineers`)

* The central roster of all engineers in the system is stored in `currentSystemData.allKnownEngineers`.
* Each engineer object includes:
    * `name`: Unique name of the engineer.
    * `level`: Numerical level (e.g., 1-7).
    * `currentTeamId`: The `teamId` of the team they are currently assigned to as a primary member (null if unassigned).
    * `attributes`: An extensible object containing:
        * `isAISWE` (boolean): True if the engineer is an AI Software Engineer.
        * `aiAgentType` (string): Specifies the type of AI agent (e.g., "Code Generation", "Testing") if `isAISWE` is true.
        * `skills` (array of strings): List of the engineer's skills.
        * `yearsOfExperience` (number): Years of industry experience.

### Away-Team Members

* Engineers borrowed from other teams, business units, or organizations to supplement a team's capacity.
* Tracked within each team's `awayTeamMembers` array. Each member has `name`, `level`, `sourceTeam`, and `attributes` (similar to `allKnownEngineers` for consistency, e.g., for AI away-members).
* These members contribute to a team's **Effective BIS (Builders In Seats)**.

### Managers (SDMs, Senior Managers, Project Managers)

* **Software Development Manager (SDM):** Manages one or more 2-Pizza Teams.
    * Attributes: `sdmId`, `sdmName`, `seniorManagerId` (their direct manager), and an extensible `attributes` object.

    * `roi`: An object detailing Return on Investment: `{ category, valueType, estimatedValue, currency, timeHorizonMonths, confidenceLevel, calculationMethodology, businessCaseLink, overrideJustification, attributes }`.
    * `targetDueDate` (string: "YYYY-MM-DD").
    * `actualCompletionDate` (string: "YYYY-MM-DD").
    * `status` (string: e.g., "Backlog", "Defined", "Committed", "In Progress", "Completed").

    * **Standard Leave Types (`leaveTypes`):** Array of objects like `{ id, name, defaultEstimatedDays, attributes }` (e.g., Annual, Sick, Study, In-Lieu).
    * **Per Team (`team.teamCapacityAdjustments`):**
        * `leaveUptakeEstimates` (array): Objects like `{ leaveTypeId, estimatedUptakePercent }` for team-specific uptake of standard leave.
        * `variableLeaveImpact` (object): Total team days lost for types like `{ maternity: { affectedSDEs, avgDaysPerAffectedSDE } }`.

## 6. Tips & Best Practices

* **Save Regularly:** Use the "Save" buttons frequently to persist your changes.
* **Iterative Definition:** Start with high-level entities and gradually add detail.
* **Use the Dashboard:** Regularly check the Strategic Goals and Accomplishments dashboards to track progress and celebrate wins.
* **Roadmap vs. Year Plan:** Use the "Roadmap & Backlog" view for broader strategic planning and the "Year Plan" view for detailed engineering capacity allocation.

---

## 7. Known Limitations (MVP)

* **Single User, Local Storage:** Data is saved in your browser's local storage. No multi-user collaboration.
* **Limited Import/Export:** General import/export for initiatives/plans to CSV/Excel is a future enhancement (though tables built with `EnhancedTableWidget` like Engineer List and Roadmap Table support export).
* **No True Skill Matching:** While skills are tracked for engineers, there's no automated matching to initiative requirements for resource suggestions.
* **UI for Advanced Planning Entities:** While the data model supports Goals, Themes, Project Managers, Work Packages, and Plan Archiving, dedicated UI views for managing all aspects of these are still under development or planned.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements (Backlog Highlights)

This tool is an evolving MVP. Key future enhancements include:

* **Detailed Planning Module:** UI for managing Goals (linking initiatives), Work Packages (phases, status, team assignments, dependencies), and task breakdowns.
* **Enhanced Yearly Planning UI:** Full UI support for editing all new initiative fields (ROI, due dates, personnel, etc.) directly in the planning table or a detail panel. UI for managing `archivedYearlyPlans`.
* **AI-Powered Enhancements:**
    * Conversational AI assistant for data querying and insights.
    * AI-assisted system modeling and plan optimization.
    * Analysis of team composition and hiring risks.
* **Data Access Layer Refactoring:** Complete the abstraction of data operations for easier future backend integration.
* **EnhancedTableWidget Rollout:** Apply the widget to more tables (e.g., Planning Table, Team Load Summary) for consistent filtering/export.
* **Collaboration & Cloud Sync:** For multi-user access and data persistence beyond local storage.
