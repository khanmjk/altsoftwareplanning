# altsoftwareplanning - software management tools
Experimenting with building a tool for software planning working backwards from software architecture and teams composition
The code is crude, single file with html/javascript - becoming a monolith
This is just me experiementing, using chatGPT as my copilot to help build this thing out (it's been a long time since I've coded!)
The idea behind this tool is to close a gap with project planning software projects, by starting first with the system architecture and working backwards from there.
The goal is to make planning automatic, using knowledge of the dependency graphs and relationships that exist within the software ecosystem.
A tool for guiding software project planning based on reality.
Eventually, foresee a way to export the data into other project planning tools.
